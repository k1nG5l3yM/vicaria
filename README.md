# .:Vicaria:. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/k1nG5l3yM/vicaria.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/k1nG5l3yM/vicaria)

## What is it?
Vicaria is a Java based open source http proxy server cloned and rebranded from the Java HTTP Proxy Server (jHTTPp2), developed by Benjamin Kohl - http://jhttp2.sourceforge.net  
So, jHTTPp2 is the foundation and Vicaria simply compliments it.   

---

## Status
The project is still in its infancy stage and should be treated as experimental and not production ready, since the original project development and support stopped in 2006. Current project (Vicaria) hopefully will pick up from where things stopped and progress further to a mature product. 

---

## Download and Quick start
### Requirements
* Java 1.8 and above  

### Installation
Vicaria does not have/require any installation steps. On Windows, simply execute the 'vicaria.bat' file and on '*nix', the bash script can be used. On successful execution, an instance of the server with default configurations will be spawned and listening on 'http://localhost:8088'.  
Feel free to update the configs under the 'server.properties' file. To understand more on the config, please refer to manual located in the 'htdocs' directory.
